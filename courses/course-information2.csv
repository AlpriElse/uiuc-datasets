Accordingly, we will attempt to analyze these issues, make sense of the fundamental forces behind these dynamics, and understand their managerial implications. The class will focus then on the roots of International Business, and complement this focus with important practical implications and 'real-world' examples and cases - the ambition will always be to wed good theory with practice. 2 graduate hours.

While writers struggled with the changes and dangers of a nation and world in such unprecedented flux, the poetry, plays, fiction, memoirs, and films they produced in response to this new precariousness forged a fertile artistic moment, in popular literature that sustained previous traditions (in realism, science fiction, children's literature, and romance) and in an avant-garde opposed to all forms of social and literary conformity.
